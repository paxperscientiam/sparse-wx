Privacy Policy for SparseWx

Information Collection?
===
Collected information comes in two forms: 1) that allowed by your authorization and 2) that which you submit via the addon.

The following Google authorization scopes are used.
* "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.addons.execute",
  * Required to run addon.
* "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly",
  * To determine your timezone.
* "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request",
  * To access US National Weather Service [API](https://forecast-v3.weather.gov/documentation)
* "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.locale"

See Google's official [documentation](https://developers.google.com/gmail/add-ons/concepts/scopes) for more information.

Usage of Information
===
The information you submit via addon forms is strictly for providing expressed services.

`SparseWx` has (limited) customization options. Here is what I do with the information you submit:
* Name: This is the name that you expressly provide and is strictly optional.
* Forecast location: This is an address, ZIP code, state, or city that you provide. `SparseWx` only provides a weather forecast for the location provided.
* Temperature scale: This is your preferred temperature scale: the choices are "Fahrenheit" and "Celsius."

Information Sharing
===
When the user provides a valid location, `SparseWx` sends some of that data to the US National Weather Serivce. The NWS provides the weather data for the user specified location.

I will never share your information with an third-party.
